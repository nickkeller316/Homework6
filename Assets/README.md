# DU coding bootcamp

# Functionality

For this project we created an app that displays current and forecasted weather for a searched city via the OpenWeather API
The user can search a city in the navbar search button
The user is then shown the current weather conditions for that city
The user can also see the 5 day forecast for that city
The user can also see their previously searched cities and search for those cities again

# Development

For the project we used fetch with our api calls (concatination as well)
We used DOM manipulation to display the weather in the proper cards
We used local storage to store user values
